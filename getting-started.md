# Getting Started with IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Beta release

Get early access to the [IBM Cloud VPC experience](about-vpc-beta.html) by participating in our Beta trial. To request access, send email to [virtualprivatecloud@ibm.com](mailto:virtualprivatecloud@ibm.com) with your use case and include your IBM Cloud Account ID. Follow [these instructions](how-to-get-account.html) to get your account information. After you send your request, you can expect to be added to the Beta release whitelist within 2-3 days. 

## Conditions

By participating in this Beta release, you agree to these conditions:

* Functionality testing only
* Feedback required
* Experimental use only, work cannot be migrated
* Abide by the quotas
* No Service Level Agreement

The conditions are explained further in the sections that follow.

### Functionality Testing Only

Test the VPC functionality and provide feedback. Testing should be limited to functionality (no scale, performance, load, or pressure testing). 

### Feedback Required

Your feedback will help us improve the offering! Please give us your feedback at this email address: [vpc@us.ibm.com](mailto:vpc@us.updateibm.com).

### Experimental Use Only

Please note that this Beta release is provided for experimental purposes only. As features are deployed during the Beta timeframe, any or all of your work could be lost with short notice. At the end of the Beta trial period, the resources you've created will not be available and cannot be migrated.

### Quotas

Resources are limited in the Beta environment, therefore the following quotas have been imposed per account.

|   Resource     | Maximum Number |
| ------- | :------: |
| Virtual Private Clouds | 5 per account|
| Subnets | 3 per Virtual Private Cloud |
| Servers (VSIs) | 25 per account |
| Floating IP addresses | 1 per server |

### Service Level Agreement (SLA)

The VPC Beta release does not have a Service Level Agreement. All issues are handled as **minor severity** with next business day response.
