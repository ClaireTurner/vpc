## http_request_size_exceeded                    
**Message**: The HTTP request is too large.

This problem occurs when the payload you have sent in your request is too large. You must try again, with a smaller payload. for example, instead of trying to do everything in a single request, try creating a minimal resource in one request, and then appending state to it incrementally in several subsequent requests. Consult the [RIAS API documentation](apis.html){: new_window} for the endpoint you are calling, to see what alternatives exist.

## validation_max_value
**Message**: The value supplied was too large.

Supply a smaller value. For further instructions to fix this problem, refer to the [API documentation](apis.html){: new_window}.

## validation_min_value
**Message**: The value supplied was too small.

Supply a larger value. For further instructions to fix this problem, refer to the [API documentation](apis.html){: new_window}.

For example, if you specify
```
{
protocol: icmp
port_min: 5
port_max: 100
}
```

The protocol is `icmp`, and _port_min_ is a `tcp` field, so you'll get an error.

2. validation_discriminator_forbidden for `tcp` fields with `icmp` specified

For further instructions to fix this problem, refer to the [API documentation](apis.html){: new_window}.
